# MX Phinx Migrations

## About

The **MX_PhinxMigrations** module integrates [Phinx](https://phinx.org) database migrations into Magento 2 as a 
replacement for the built-in `setup:upgrade` method of triggering schema and data changes, therefore enabling zero-downtime
deployments.

## Why?

The idea of this module is to avoid having to change module versions (in `module.xml` files) in order to trigger database
changes in Magento. When Magento bootstraps itself it verifies that all module versions in the `setup_module` database table
match the versions on disk. If a module version in the database does not match the version in our code then Magento will error
and show something like:

> 1 exception(s):\
> Exception #0 (Magento\Framework\Exception\LocalizedException): Please upgrade your database: Run "bin/magento setup:upgrade" from the Magento root directory.\
>  The following modules are outdated:\
>  Acme_Foo schema: current version - 0.2.0, required version - 0.3.0\
>  Acme_Foo data: current version - 0.2.0, required version - 0.3.0

If we consider the following high level deployment process, this makes zero-downtime deployments impossible due to the fact 
that at some point, even if just for a very short time, the code and database versions will be out of sync between steps
2 and 3:

1. Build Magento container
2. Before deploying the new container(s), run `setup:upgrade` process on the target environment database
3. Deploy the new container(s)

## Requirements

The module is currently supported on Magento >= 2.1.

## Installing

Add the module to the require section of the composer file:

```
$ composer require mx/module-phinx-migrations
```

## Enabling the module

```
$ bin/magento setup:upgrade
$ bin/magento c:c
```

We can verify that the module is enabled by running the status command:

```
$ bin/magento module:status MX_PhinxMigrations
```

## The phinx configuration file

After installing the module you will need to create a `phinx.php` file in your project root folder.

An example can be found [here](etc/phinx.php). There should be no further changes required to this file but it can be
edited as necessary for your project setup.

## Using

Migrations are custom classes that extend `phinx` migrations and execute some code to change the DB. Migration class files
can sit in any of your Magento modules (`phinx` will scan for all migration folders at run time) in the following locations:

* `src/*/*/etc/migrations`
* `app/code/*/*/etc/migrations`

### Creating a migration

`phinx` can create a migration for us. For example

    bin/phinx create AddProductPimIdAttribute

It will then ask us which module we want to add the migration file to:

    Which migrations path would you like to use?
      [0] src/Foo/Catalog/etc/migrations
      [1] src/Foo/Sales/etc/migrations
     >

When the migration file is created in the selected destination we should see a class similar to the following:

    <?php

    use MX\PhinxMigrations\Migration;

    class AddProductPimIdAttribute extends Migration
    {
        /**
         * Upgrade the database.
         */
        public function up()
        {

        }

        /**
         * Rollback the database.
         */
        public function down()
        {

        }
    }

When writing our migration we should always include rollback code so that we can reverse deployments easily.

#### Magento setup helpers

We have access to 3 different setup helpers provided by Magento in each migration:

1. `$this->schemaSetup` (instance of `Magento\Framework\Setup\SchemaSetupInterface`)
2. `$this->dataSetup` (instance of `Magento\Framework\Setup\ModuleDataSetupInterface`)
3. `$this->eavSetup` (instance of `Magento\Eav\Setup\EavSetup`)

### Execute migrations

When you are happy with your migration you can execute it as follows

    bin/phinx migrate

### Rolling back

If you want to undo your migration then simply execute

    bin/phinx rollback

## Limitations

1. Upgrading Magento itself will still result in version changes in the Magento `module.xml` files, therefore zero-downtime 
deployments are not possible in this situation.

## FAQ / troubleshooting

Q. When I run `bin/phinx create ...` it cannot find any migration paths to create the migration file, why?

A. In order for a migration to be created `phinx` will scan your project for `migration` folders in the paths mentioned in the
[section above](#using). Make sure you create at least one `migration` folder inside one of your Magento module's `etc` folders
and then it should work as expected.
